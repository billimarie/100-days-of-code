# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: June 27th 2016

### Today's Progress

#### portfolio
- new favicon
- updated section scroll onclick with [AnimateScroll](http://plugins.compzets.com/animatescroll/)
- added [100 Days of Code](http://www.billimarie.com/portfolio/doc.html) page
- created 100 Days of Code graphic

#### misc
- updated resources on [100 days of code repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code/pull/2)
- updated Trello cards

### Thoughts
Now that I've got a homebase, it's nice to be doing work, again. I know the pitfalls of not practicing code; the 100 days idea is great for keeping your skills up when you're working on other projects. For now, I'm just using this as a way to improve my portfolio and resume, but I'd like to go back to my list of projects to one day build out (including [Pipe Dream Tactics](http://pipedreamtactics.wordpress.com)).

## Day 2: June 28th 2016

### Today's Progress

- div overlay on full-screen YT video
- researched YT API

#### 360&deg; YouTube Video Embeds + three.js
Just messing around. Trying to see if there's a way to manipulate the 360 controller. Searched the YT API but it seems like that functionality isn't available, yet. Ideally would like to disable the mousedown / drag function and create a camera that follows mouse movement.

### Thoughts
today was a hot day. disheartened over lack of support for 360&deg; functionality (re: YouTube).

#### CSS Animations
Inspired by an old poetry collection I wrote called Tetronimoes. Wanted to see if a multimedia poem would be the best fit for a revised edition.
- multimedia poem
- shadows, position, & color transitions

### Thoughts
Laptop is 'fixed'. Hardware's good but still having some random shut off issues...thanks, Apple.

Working on a multimedia poetry project; CSS3 & JS for the titles are finished, plus spacing for the poem itself. Just need to figure out what the main text should do.

#### Spot the Docs
- dev env setup

### Thoughts
Setting up my dev environment has become a lot easier over the years. I remember when it used to take me an entire day. Guess practice really does make things less burdensome.

## Day 9: July 13th 2016

### Today's Progress

#### Spot the Docs
- pushed to [Heroku](https://floating-citadel-84168.herokuapp.com/)
- pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/billimarie/spot-the-docs)

### Thoughts
It sucks to get stumped on such simple stuff. I'm studying for the LSAT and there is a definite connect between the type of logic it tests and coding. One wrong misstep can lead down a rabbit hole of bad decisions. Today was that kind of day. But at least I can take steps to see what went wrong, and where.

I'm making the decision to work on the fundamentals. Practice makes perfect...or maybe just less rabbit holes.

...& when did GitHub update their fonts!? :o
