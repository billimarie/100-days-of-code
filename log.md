#### Today's Progress

###### portfolio
- new favicon

###### misc
- updated resources on [100 days of code repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code/pull/2)
- updated Trello cards

#### Thoughts
Now that I've got a homebase, it's nice to be doing work, again. I know the pitfalls of not practicing code; the 100 days idea is great for keeping your skills up when you're working on other projects. For now, I'm just using this as a way to improve my portfolio and resume, but I'd like to go back to my list of projects to one day build out (including [Pipe Dream Tactics](http://pipedreamtactics.wordpress.com)).

### Day 2: June 28th 2016

#### Today's Progress

- div overlay on full-screen YT video
- researched YT API

###### 360&deg; YouTube Video Embeds + three.js
Just messing around. Trying to see if there's a way to manipulate the 360 controller. Searched the YT API but it seems like that functionality isn't available, yet. Ideally would like to disable the mousedown / drag function and create a camera that follows mouse movement.

#### Thoughts
today was a hot day. disheartened over lack of support for 360&deg; functionality (re: YouTube).
