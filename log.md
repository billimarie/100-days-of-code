#### Thoughts
Now that I've got a homebase, it's nice to be doing work, again. I know the pitfalls of not practicing code; the 100 days idea is great for keeping your skills up when you're working on other projects. For now, I'm just using this as a way to improve my portfolio and resume, but I'd like to go back to my list of projects to one day build out (including [Pipe Dream Tactics](http://pipedreamtactics.wordpress.com)).
