# 100DaysOfCode
100DaysOfCode is an online community of people challenging themselves to consistently code. You can join in whenever you'd like; google **#100DaysOfCode** for more information.

### Mission

As a freelancer, I often find my skills deteriorate while working on projects that don't demand new programming challenges.

To combat the atrophy, I decided join the #100DaysOfCode repo and keep tabs on the time I spent coding. The public repo helps keep me accountable...and aiming for consistency + daily habits helps commit me to the practice.

### Projects

To keep up with the projects I've been working on, visit the [Playground]({{ site.url }}/projects) page.

### Acknowledgements

Huge thank you to [@Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway) for not only creating the project, but participating in its community.

And of course, a shout out to everyone else floating in 100 days of code.
