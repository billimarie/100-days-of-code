Nearly finished with a client's website. And now that I've got all my dev environment woes out of the way, I can resume the mad rush for gigs.
<div style="margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px 0 25px; text-align: center"><a href="{{ site.github.url }}/day/012/"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/sI8yKrHIpQpc4/giphy.gif" /></a></div>

Retaught myself WordPress functions. Fun with WordPress PHP.

I think my favorite part of coding is the coming up with dummy content.

### Client website

- Built a child theme from Automattic's *[Dyad](https://wordpress.org/themes/dyad/)*
- Created new responsive CSS behaviors for the header
- Updated pages, menus, footers, posts

### Links

- TBD
