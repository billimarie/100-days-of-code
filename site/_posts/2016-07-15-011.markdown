Mistakes are often made when you don't know any better.

Well. This was my day.

Exhausted, but I finally perfected the password authentication + various WordPress installations challenge.

Originally, I used DreamHosts' `Goodies > HTAccess` setup. It took hours before realizing the passwords that were generated were not the same encrypted versions to copy/paste into the `.htpasswd` document.

...lesson learned. A few more:

### Always look at the log

If you use DreamHost, you can find the error log by going to `/home/USERNAME/logs/WEBSITE/http/error.log`. I would have saved a lot of time if I checked the logs before assuming I could figure out the answer by just pounding my head against the keyboard repeatedly.

Errors included:

- `Password Mismatch`
- `File does not exist` (lack of error documents)
- `User not found`
- `Permission denied`

### Mindful process of elimination

Instead of eliminating at will and hoping to cycle through the answer (which takes up way too much time), it's a good idea to carefully consider the what's and the why's. While this is obvious, I think a lot of us tend to get caught up in the moment of solving something that we rush toward the answer without thinking too heavily about why certain steps *aren't* the solution.

Gentle reminders to slow down, actually analyze (rather than running with a potential fix), and remember it for next time.

The hellish cycle of almost-fixes:

- testing out the password-protected subdirectory
- uploading indexes and error files
- various stackoverflow answers for the .htaccess files
- moving the .htaccess and .htpasswd files around
- wait, maybe I should actually install the second WP site
- consider symlinks!?

And finally, the solution.

In `/home/username/website/.htaccess`:

    ErrorDocument 401 default

    # BEGIN WordPress

    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
    </IfModule>

    # END WordPress

Remember that the password typed in the DreamHost wizard will look like this:

`username password`

but in `/home/username/website/.htpasswd`, it should look like this:

`username:encrypted-password`

And finally, `/home/username/website/subdirectory/.htaccess`:

    ErrorDocument 401 default

    # BEGIN WordPress
    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /subdirectory/
    RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule . /subdirectory/index.php [L]
    </IfModule>

    # END WordPress

    ### Generated by Dreamhost. DO NOT modify!!! ###
    AuthType Basic
    AuthUserFile /home/username/website/.htpasswd
    AuthName 'AnyNameHere'
    require valid-user

Reminders for next time.

The good news is I managed to get the password-protected portal up and running. A client is using it now for creating content.

Tomorrow I'm going to knock out the WordPress site, & hope for no more missteps.

### password-protected portal

- .htaccess
- .htpasswd
