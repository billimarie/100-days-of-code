Laptop is 'fixed'. Hardware's good but still having some random shut off issues...thanks, Apple.

Working on a multimedia poetry project; CSS3 & JS for the titles are finished, plus spacing for the poem itself. Just need to figure out what the main text should do.

### CSS Animations
Inspired by an old poetry collection I wrote called Tetronimoes. Wanted to see if a multimedia poem would be the best fit for a revised edition.
- multimedia poem
- shadows, position, & color transitions
