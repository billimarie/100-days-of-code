## Thoughts
It sucks to get stumped on such simple stuff. I'm studying for the LSAT and there is a definite connect between the type of logic it tests and coding. One wrong misstep can lead down a rabbit hole of bad decisions. Today was that kind of day. But at least I can take steps to see what went wrong, and where.

I'm making the decision to work on the fundamentals. Practice makes perfect...or maybe just less rabbit holes.

...& when did GitHub update their fonts!? :o
