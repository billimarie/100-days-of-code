## Projects

- div overlay on full-screen YT video
- researched YT API

### 360&deg; YouTube Video Embeds + three.js
Just messing around. Trying to see if there's a way to manipulate the 360 controller. Searched the YT API but it seems like that functionality isn't available, yet. Ideally would like to disable the mousedown / drag function and create a camera that follows mouse movement.

today was a hot day. disheartened over lack of support for 360&deg; functionality (re: YouTube).

### Link(s) to work
