##Thoughts

After creating a project page for **Spot the Docs**, I decided to make one for the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I chose Jekyll because of its widespread adoption and its reputation for syncing with GitHub.

This will be much cleaner than re-editing log.md every so often.

Keep forgetting that I renamed GitHub's remote `origin` to `github` so I don't confuse myself with remote `heroku`.

MkDocs' built-in devserver (`mkdocs serve`) is a lot of fun. Auto-reload! It's like instant render ðŸ’ž

Not a fan of Jekyll's, as I have to keep shutting down the server and restart whenever I make config changes...plus it's not instantaneous.
